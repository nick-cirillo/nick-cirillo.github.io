I could tell you were lonely<br/>
From the moment you walked in<br/>
From the way you had your makeup on<br/>
From the way you&apos;d done your hair<br/>
From the way you sat down next to me<br/>
From the way you ordered your drink<br/>
From the moment you put your hand on my knee<br/>
I knew I&apos;d have you with ease<br/>
Do you come here often?<br/>
Do you know how this thing works?<br/>
Do you go to bed with a different man every night?<br/>
Don&apos;t tell me I&apos;m the first<br/><br/>

You must have heard about me<br/>
Everyone knows my name<br/>
Everyone knows I&apos;m holy<br/>
Holy, holy, holy, holy<br/>
All the revolutionaries (Holy, holy)<br/>
All the Jihadis too (Holy, holy)<br/>
&apos;Round the world, I&apos;m holy (Holy, holy)<br/><br/>

Holy, holy, holy, holy<br/>
Holy, holy, holy, holy<br/>
Holy, holy, holy, holy<br/>
Holy, holy<br/><br/>

Do you know my name?<br/>
Of course, you know my name<br/>
Everyone does, it&apos;s true<br/>
It&apos;s true, it&apos;s true, it&apos;s true<br/>
That I&apos;m known around here<br/>
The barmaids know my name<br/>
I&apos;ve had them all before<br/>
You are new, I&apos;ll have you too<br/>
It&apos;s time to give in<br/>
From the shores of Havana<br/>
To Moscow and Tokyo<br/>
In French Guyanese, in Cantonese<br/>
Everyone knows my name<br/><br/>

Holy<br/>
All the revolutionaries (Holy, holy)<br/>
All the Jihadis too (Holy, holy)<br/>
Everyone knows I&apos;m holy (Holy, holy)<br/>
How &apos;bout we dance some salsa? (Holy, holy)<br/>
I&apos;ll spin you round and round (Holy, holy)<br/>
On the dance floor, I&apos;m holy (Holy, holy)<br/>
How &apos;bout we take this further? (Holy, holy)<br/>
I&apos;ll meet you in the bathroom (Holy, holy)<br/>
I&apos;ll bet your pussy is holy too<br/><br/>

I&apos;ll arrive at around 7pm<br/>
And I want you to get there no later than 10<br/>
I want you to be dressed like a sophisticated tart<br/>
With too much makeup on, will that be alright?<br/>
And I want you to sit down next to me, as if by chance<br/>
I want it to seem like we&apos;ve never met before<br/>
How much will that cost?<br/>
I want you to look unsure of yourself<br/>
And I want you to look at me as if I&apos;m attractive<br/>
I want your eyes to say, &quot;Take me&quot;<br/>
And I want your lips to be unimpressed<br/>
And I want you to ask the waiter if I really am who I say I am<br/>
And I want you to blush<br/>
I want you to shoot a smug look at the other girls<br/>
To make them jealous I chose you<br/>
When I tell you your pussy is holy<br/>
I want you to slap me and then kiss me<br/>
Make sure everybody&apos;s watching, kiss me and then walk away<br/>
Walk to the bathroom, I&apos;ll follow after<br/>
Don&apos;t worry, we won&apos;t do anything<br/>
We&apos;ll just loiter there fifteen minutes or so<br/>
Then I&apos;ll choose your new lipstick and we&apos;ll walk back out<br/>
And I want you to tell me I&apos;m a perfect dancer<br/>
And I want you to tell me I smell great<br/>
I want you to make me look taller<br/>
Could you kneel down the whole time?<br/>
How much will that cost?<br/>
I want you to put your hand on my knee<br/>
Will that be alright?<br/>
I want you to look at me as if you&apos;re lost<br/>
How much will that cost?<br/><br/>

Thank you so much<br/>
We&apos;ll meet the same time next week<br/>
And the next week after that too<br/>
And the next week after that<br/>
And the next month, and the next...<br/>
